    """
    In this problem you will read data from a file and perform a simple mathematical operation on each data point. 
    Each line is supposed to contain a floating point number.
    But what you will observe is that some lines might have erroneous entries. 
    You need to ignore those lines (Hint: Use Exception handling).

    The idea is to implement a function which reads in a file and computes the median 
    of the numbers and returns the output. You may use the inbuilt function sort when computing the median.

    DO NOT USE ANY INBUILT OR OTHER FUNCTION TO DIRECTLY COMPUTE MEDIAN
